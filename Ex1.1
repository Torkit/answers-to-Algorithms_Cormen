1.1.1
Given a real-world example for the following problems.
Ans:1) sorting, 
teacher wants to recommend the top 5 stduents to get the scholarship,thus it needs sort the scores in descending order;
2)the best order for multiplying matrices, 
graphics transformation
3)convex hull
find the bounding box to locate the object approximately


1.1.2
Other measures of efficiency may be used in real-world.
Ans:memory usuage, CPU usuage, Disk I/O, precision, recall rate.


1.1.3
Discuss a data structure, about its strengths and its limitations.
Ans: linked list is an efficient structure, add/delete operation takes only O(1) time, but get/query operation takes O(n) time, 
it can't support randomly to get one item.


1.1.4
The similarity and difference between shortest-path and traveling-salesman problems.
Ans: the similarity is they need to find a shortest path in a weighted, indirected graph.
the difference is shortest-path needs to find a path only from the start vertex to the end vertex; traveling-salesman needs to find a path crossing all the vertexes only one time and then come back to the start vertex;
