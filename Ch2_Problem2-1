Ch2_P2-1
Insertion sort on small arrays in merge sort. Consider a modification to merge sort in which n/k sublists of length k are sorted using insertion sort and then merged using the standard merging mechanism, where k is a value to be determined.
a. Show that n/k sublists, can be sorted by insertion sort in O(nk) worst-case time.
Ans:
The length of each sublist is k, so the running time of each sublist is O(k^2) by insertion-sort. Then the worse-case running time of n/k sublists is n/k*O(k^2) = O(nk).


b.Show that sublists can be merged in O(nlg(n/k)) worst-case time.
Ans:
Using divide-and conquer algorithm, the pseudocode is:
Merge-Sublists(A, n, k, p, r)
  //p, r is the multiple of k
  if r - p >= k   //it exists 2 sublists
	num = (r-p)/k   //how many sublist
	mid = p + num/2 * k
	Merge-Sublists(A, n, k, p, mid)
	Merge-Sublists(A, n, k, mid+k, r)
	Merge(A, p, r)
	
	
Following the merge-sort analysis, T(m) = {2T(m/2) + O(mk), m > 1;  0, m = 1}, and O(mk) is the running time of merging m sublists, each of length k.
We guess T(m) = mklgm.
Using induction, 
Base: T(1) = klg1 = 0, true.
Step: Suppose T(l) = lklgl, then 
 T(2l) 	= 2T(l) + O(2lk) 
      	= 2lklgl + O(2lk) 
  	= 2lk(lgl + O(1))
	= 2lk(lgl + O(lg2))
	= 2lklg2l
So we prove T(2l) = 2lklg2l.
And m = n/k, so the worst-case time is O(nlg(n/k)).



c.The modified algorithm runs in O(nk+nlg(n/k)) worst-case time, what is the largest asymptotic
value of k as a function of n for which the modified algorithm has the same asymptotic running 
time as standard merge sort?
Ans:
We know, when k = 1, there are n sublists, it is the same as merge-sort; 
when k = n, only 1 sublist, it is the same as insertion-sort.
Normally O(nlgn) <= O(nk + nlg(n/k)), 
 =>	O(nk) <= O(nlgn) < O(nk+nlg(n/k)), k > 1
 => 	k <= lgn
Then we substitute lgn for, O(nk+nlg(n/k) = O(nlgn + nlg(n/lgn)) = O(nlgn).
if k > lgn, then O(nk) > O(nlgn), which is larger than running time of merge-sort.



d. How should k be chosen in practice?
Like Ex1.2-2, we need to know the constant factors of merge-sort and insertion-sort, then we can
pick the number of k, which makes insertion-sort beat merge-sort.
